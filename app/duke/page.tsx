                        <p className="p1">This project was one of my responsibilities as a product designer at a motor company.</p>
                        <p className="p1">As a Taiwanese, the "Duke" motorcycle series has been an iconic name that we've known our entire lives. "Duke" was a very popular scooter during the '90s. It's been a legend for the scooter market for around 15 years.<br></br>
                            <br></br>
                            In 2017, our company decided to launch a new scooter under the "Duke" name, hoping it would recapture the success of the original. However, the 2017 model shared only the name and none of the essence of its predecessor. As a lifelong fan of the original Duke, it was disheartening to see the name attached to a product so different from its roots.<br></br>
                            <br></br>The 2017 model struggled to gain a positive reputation. Most customers purchased it solely for its affordability, not its quality or features. By 2020, the scooter was falling behind its competitors, and its product life cycle was nearing its end. It was clear that change was needed. <br></br> <br></br></p>

                    <h1>Research About the Market</h1>
                    <p className="p1">To gain a deeper understanding of the market and the product, I examined the history of the Duke series, the market dynamics of the 1990-2010 period, and the current market landscape.</p>
                    <div className="row work-research col-12">

                            <p className="p1">I analyzed the sales data for the entire under-250cc scooter market (the next-level license category) to demonstrate to the C-level executives the size and importance of the 125cc market. I highlighted why it was essential to continue supporting this segment and, most importantly, why the 2017 Duke needed an upgrade and redesign.</p>
                            <div className="duke-research-img col-10 mx-auto col-md d-block">

                            </div>
                            <p className="p1">In the under-250cc market, the 125cc segment represents the majority. Within this segment, the largest sales category, which we refer to as the "normal" class, includes the Duke. This class holds the biggest market shareâ€”almost half of the entire 125cc market.</p>
                            <div className="duke-research-img col-10 mx-auto col-md d-block">

                            <p className="p1">The "normal" class targets male users aged 36-55 who rely on scooters for daily commuting. When purchasing a scooter, they prioritize affordability over style or advanced features.</p>

                            <p className="p1">Previously, it was widely assumed that although the two models differed in size, they shared the same target users, with customers simply choosing the better deal or selecting based on physical size preferences. However, after a detailed analysis of user demographics, purchasing behavior, and preferences, I discovered that the larger model actually appeals more to younger users and has a significantly higher proportion of male buyers compared to female buyers.</p>
                            <div className="duke-history-img">

                            </div>
                            <p className="p1">Therefore, the design of the larger model could adopt a sharper and sportier style. We can also expect its users to be more knowledgeable about scooters and to resonate more deeply with the legacy of the original Duke.</p>

                            <p className="p1">The first Duke, Duke I 150, debuted in 1990, featuring a cutting-edge engine and an original racing-inspired design. It quickly took the market by storm, becoming the most popular scooter among young riders aged 18 to 30.</p>
                            <p className="p1">Now, let's do some simple math, 'Duke' is the dream scooter for teenagers and young boys in the 90's, after 30 years now, how old are those youth in the 2020s? Exactly the age of our New Duke's target- 36 ups.</p>
                            <div className="duke-history-img">
                                <img className="col-10" src="images/project/125-market-4.jpg" alt="Duke's history" />
                            </div>
                            <p className="p1">Another historical fact is that our company began to decline around 2010, eventually hitting rock bottom. Once the leading motor brand, we fell to third place, alongside other small startups. Despite significant efforts to boost sales, it has been a long time since shareholders and veteran employees saw our market share exceed 20%. While the memories of our former glory remain vivid in their minds, that era has come to an end.
                                Therefore, let me show you how I brought back the golden age and revived their dreams with the all-new Duke 2022.</p>

                            <p className="p1">We attempt involved using an SUV as inspiration due to the similarities in target audiences and development history. Unfortunately, this approach also failed, as the body design requirements for cars and motorcycles are too different.</p>
                            <h4 className="duke-design d-flex">3rd Round</h4>
                            <p className="p1">I decided to focus on the key features of the classic Dukes, blending them with a fresh design style. The result was a new version of the classic Duke!</p>
